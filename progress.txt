# Ralph Development Progress

## 2026-01-16: Testing Infrastructure (Feature #1)

### Completed
- Created `ralph_test.go` with comprehensive unit tests for core functions
- Added 22 test cases covering:
  - `detectBuildSystem()` - 15 test cases for all build system types (100% coverage)
  - `applyBuildSystemConfig()` - 12 test cases for config application (64% coverage)
  - `isCursorAgent()` - 8 test cases for agent detection (100% coverage)
  - `buildPrompt()` - 2 test cases for prompt construction (88% coverage)
  - `readPlanFile()` - 3 test cases for plan file parsing (100% coverage)
  - `filterPlans()` - 4 test cases for plan filtering (100% coverage)
  - `extractAndWritePlan()` - 4 test cases for JSON extraction (78% coverage)
  - `appendProgress()` - tests for progress file operations (78% coverage)
- Updated Makefile with new targets:
  - `make test-coverage` - runs tests with coverage report
  - `make test-coverage-html` - generates HTML coverage report
  - Updated `clean` target to remove coverage files

### Coverage Summary
- Core logic functions: 80-100% coverage
- Overall: 24.9% (integration functions like main(), executeAgent() excluded from unit tests)

### Notes for Next Developer
- The test suite uses temporary directories for file-based tests, ensuring clean isolation
- Tests for `detectBuildSystem()` change directories during execution, so they restore the original dir after each test
- Integration tests for `executeAgent()` and `runIterations()` would require mocking external commands
- Consider adding table-driven tests for `validateConfig()` in future iterations

## 2026-01-16: Modular Package Refactoring (Feature #2)

### Completed
- Refactored codebase into modular `internal/` package structure:
  - `internal/config` - Config struct and constants (DefaultPlanFile, DefaultProgressFile, DefaultAgentCmd)
  - `internal/detection` - Build system detection and presets (DetectBuildSystem, ApplyBuildSystemConfig, BuildSystemPresets)
  - `internal/plan` - Plan file operations (Plan struct, ReadFile, Filter, Print, ExtractAndWrite)
  - `internal/agent` - Agent execution (IsCursorAgent, Execute)
  - `internal/prompt` - Prompt building (CompleteSignal, BuildIterationPrompt, BuildPlanGenerationPrompt)
- Updated main `ralph.go` to import and use internal packages
- Updated all tests to use the new package structure
- All 24 tests passing, build successful

### Package Structure
```
ralph/
├── ralph.go              # Main entry point, CLI parsing, orchestration
├── ralph_test.go         # Tests (use internal packages)
└── internal/
    ├── config/
    │   └── config.go     # Config struct, defaults
    ├── detection/
    │   └── detection.go  # Build system detection, presets
    ├── plan/
    │   └── plan.go       # Plan struct, file operations
    ├── agent/
    │   └── agent.go      # Agent execution
    └── prompt/
        └── prompt.go     # Prompt construction
```

### Notes for Next Developer
- The internal packages are designed to be independent with minimal cross-dependencies
- Only `detection` imports `config` (for ApplyBuildSystemConfig)
- Only `agent` imports `config` (for Execute function)
- Only `prompt` imports `config` (for BuildIterationPrompt)
- The main package orchestrates all internal packages
- Consider adding package-level tests in each internal package for better isolation
- Future features should follow the package-per-concern pattern established here
